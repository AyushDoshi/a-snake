                    For my anatomy reflection project this summer, I built the web game to your right, which I call "Anatomy Snake". Based on the classic game "Snake", 
					"Anatomy Snake" is a new rendition where you guide a line of red blood cells through the cardiovascular system as they make their way to the heart, 
					lungs and other key organs in their mission to transfer oxygen. The web game was written in vanilla JavaScript and using Creative Commonâ€™s graphics.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    Something that I had acquired over the course of anatomy lab is a stronger respect for time and the amount of it that we have. Although relatively 
					simple, working with the donors has heightened my appreciation for life and the time we have at our disposal to use. As a result, I decided that 
					I would use some of the time that I have become more cognizant about and do something that I have always wanted to do but couldn't make time to 
					do before: learn JavaScript.
                </p>
				
				<p>
					As a result, over the course of this summer, I have been working on learning JavaScript and other associated frameworks as something that interests 
					me and that I value. This effort then culminated in the final project to your right where I was able to use the skills that I have built up and, more 
					importantly, was able to engage in an activity that I have always enjoyed but found myself not making time for until now.
